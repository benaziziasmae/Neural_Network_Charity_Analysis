# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
We use the following methods for the analysis:

- preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
- compile, train and evaluate the model,
- optimize the model.

## Resources
- Data source : [charity_data](/Resources/charity_data.csv)
- Software :Python , Anaconda Navigator, Conda, Jupyter Notebook.
